Implementing USB communication device class (CDC) on EFM32GG MCUs
===========================
## 1. Introduction
USB revolutionized the PC peripheral space by making a very simple plug-and-play interface for users. As a result, many modern computers no longer support RS-232 serial COM ports, opting for the slimmer USB alternative. This can be an issue for the developer who needs a COM port for communication between a peripheral and host PC. A subset of the USB Communication DeviceClass (CDC) can be used to emulate a serial port providing a virtual COM port UART interface. This allows developers to use legacy applications with new products using the same COM port interface as before, with few hardware and software modifications.

This application note describes the USB communications device class driver (or USB CDC) in detail and includes an implementation example for the Silicon Labs EFM32 Giant Gecko MCU.

### 1.1. Assumptions
This document assumes the following:

* A working knowledge of the C programming language.
* Familiarity with the USB 2.0 specification and terms and abbreviations defined by the USB specification.
* Familiarity with Silicon Labs EFM32GG development environment.

### 1.2. Features and Limitations
The CDC firmware implemented with this application note includes the following features:

* Emulates a serial COM port on PC that supports the CDC Abstract Control Model (ACM).
* Provides an abstract communication interface for data transfers between the host and the device.
* Handles standard Chapter 9 USB device requests.
* Handles CDC-specific requests from USB host.
* Notifies the USB host of status using an interrupt endpoint.
* Provides data communication with the USB host using a bulk endpoint.
* The following baud rates are supported: 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 76800, 115200 and 230400 bps.

The example does not implement the following:

* No CTS/RTS control is performed, so flow control must be set to nonein the terminal program.
* RTS/DTR control is not implemented.

## 3. USB CDC Class
The USB communications device class (CDC) is a composite USB device class, and the class may include more than one interface. The CDC is used primarily for modems, but also for ISDN, fax machines, and telephony applications for performing regular voice calls.
The Abstract Control Model subclass of CDC and bridges the gap between legacy modem devices and USB devices, enabling the use of application programs designed for older modems.

### 3.1. Class Requests
The class requests and class notifications supported are listed in Table 1.

__Table 1. Abstract Control Model Requests__

| Request | Code   | Description |
| ------- | ------ | -----       |
| SET_LINE_CODING  | 20h | Configures baud rate, stop-bits, parity, and numberof-character bits.    |
| GET_LINE_CODING  | 21h | Requests current DTE rate, stop-bits, parity, and number-of-character bits. |
| SET_CONTROL_LINE_STATE  | 22h | RS232 signalused to tell the DCE device the DTE device is now present.    |

These class-specific requests are used for device and call management.

### 3.1.1. Set Line Coding
This request allows the host to specify typical asynchronous line-character formatting properties.

| bmRequestType | bRequest | wValue | wIndex | wLength | Data|
| -------  | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 00100001b | SET_LINE_CODING | 0 | interface | size of structure | line coding structure |

Table 2 defines the line coding properties.

__Table 2. Line Coding Format__

| Offset | Field | Size | Value | Description |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ----- | ------      |
| 0 | dwDTERate | 4 | Number | Data terminal rate, in bits per second. |
| 4 | bCharFormat | 1 | Number | 0: 1 Stop bit <br> 1: 1.5 Stop bits <br> 2: 2 Stop bits |

| -------  | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 10100001b | GET_LINE_CODING | 0 | interface | size of structure | line coding structure |

### 3.1.3. Set Control Line State
This request generates RS-232/V.24 style control signals. Table 3 defines control signal bitmap.

| bmRequestType | bRequest | wValue | wIndex | wLength | Data|
| -------  | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 00100001b | SET_LINE_CONTROL_STATE | control signal bitmap | interface | 0 | none |


__Table 3. Control Signal Bitmap__

| Bit Position | Description |
| --------     | ------      |
| 15:2 | Reserved (Reset to zero). |
| 1 | Carrier control for half duplex modems. This signal corresponds to V.24 signal 105 and RS232 signal RTS. <br> 0: Deactivate carrier. <br> 1: Activate carrier. <br>The device ignores the value of this bit when operating in full duplex mode. |
| 0 | Indicates to DCE if DTE is present or not.This signal corresponds to V.24 signal 108/2 and RS232 signal DTR. <br> 0: DTE is not present. <br> 1: DTE is present|


### 3.2. Class Notifictions
Table 4 shows the class notifications supported by the Abstract Control Model.

__Table 4. Abstract Control Model Notifications__

| Notification | Code | Description |
| -----        | ---- | -----       |
| SERIAL_STATE | 20h | Returns the current state of the carrier detects, DSR, break, and ring signal. |

### Serial State
This notification sends an asynchronous message containing the current UART status.

| -------  | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 10100001b | SERIAL_STATE | 0 | interface | 2 | UART state bitmap |

The data field for this notification is a bitmapped value that contains the current state of detects transmission
carrier, break, ring signal, and device overrun error. These signals are typically found on a UART and are used for
communication status reporting. A state is considered enabled if its respective bit is set to 1.

__Note__: The firmware example included with this application does not currently support state change

## 4. LUFA USB Stack  
The USB CDC firmware example is based on the `LUFA` open-source project. `LUFA` is an open-source complete USB stack released under the permissive MIT License. It includes support for many USB classes, both for USB Hosts and USB Devices. For USB Devices, the `LUFA` stack includes support for Audio Class, CDC Class, HID Class, Mass Storage Class, MIDI Class, and RNDIS Class.
More information about the `LUFA` project can be found on the official website: http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php

* The USB CDC project contains a prebuilt LUFA USB stack documentation which locate at .\LUFA\Documentation\html. Double click on the index.html, the documentations shows in your default browser.

![LUFA documentation][LUFA_DOC]

__Figure 3. USB LUFA Libary Documentation__

* This implementation support two boards of EFM32GG, STK3700 and DK3750. Default setting is DK3750, To change board selection, just modify macro definition in .\LUFA\Common\BoardTypes.h. 

``` c
#if !defined(__DOXYGEN__)
    #define BOARD_                 BOARD_DK3750
    #if !defined(BOARD)
        #define BOARD              BOARD_DK3750
    #endif
#endif
```

For STK3700 board, there is no UART socket on board. UART signals are connected to EXP Header.

## 5. USB CDC Driver
The CDC class is implemented in all releases of Windows, and the operatingsystem needs an INF file for the CDC driver. This INF file contains the Vendor ID and Product ID. If the VID/PID of the USB devices matches the INF file, Windows will load the driver described in the file. The __VirtualSerial.inf__ file can be found in the __.\Demos\Device\LowLevel\EFM32Demos\VCP__ directory. 

### Installing the Driver
To install the driver on Windows 7:

1. Build the project and download firmware to the EFM32GG DK3750 board.
