Introduction\r\nUSB revolutionized the PC peripheral space by making a very simple plug-and-play interface for users. As a result, many modern computers no longer support RS-232 serial COM ports, opting for the slimmer USB alternative. This can be an issue for the developer who needs a COM port for communication between a peripheral and host PC. A subset of the USB Communication DeviceClass (CDC) can be used to emulate a serial port providing a virtual COM port UART interface. This allows developers to use legacy applications with new products using the same COM port interface as before, with few hardware and software modifications.\r\n\r\n![USB CDC Intro][USB_CDC_Intro]\r\n\r\n__Figure 1 USB CDC Virtual COM Port System__\r\n\r\nThis application note describes the USB communications device class driver (or USB CDC) in detail and includes an implementation example for the Silicon Labs EFM32 Giant Gecko MCU.\r\n\r\n### 1.1. Assumptions\r\nThis document assumes the following:\r\n\r\n* A working knowledge of the C programming language.\r\n* Familiarity with the USB 2.0 specification and terms and abbreviations defined by the USB specification.\r\n* Familiarity with Silicon Labs EFM32GG development environment.\r\n\r\n### 1.2. Features and Limitations\r\nThe CDC firmware implemented with this application note includes the following features:\r\n\r\n* Emulates a serial COM port on PC that supports the CDC Abstract Control Model (ACM).\r\n* Provides an abstract communication interface for data transfers between the host and the device.\r\n* Handles standard Chapter 9 USB device requests.\r\n* Handles CDC-specific requests from USB host.\r\n* Notifies the USB host of status using an interrupt endpoint.\r\n* Provides data communication with the USB host using a bulk endpoint.\r\n* The following baud rates are supported: 600, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, 76800, 115200 and 230400 bps.\r\n\r\nThe example does not implement the following:\r\n\r\n* No CTS/RTS control is performed, so flow control must be set to nonein the terminal program.\r\n* RTS/DTR control is not implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 2. Relevant Documentation\r\nEFM32 Giant Gecko Application Notes are listed on the following website: www.silabs.com/32bit-appnotes.\r\n\r\n* __AN758 IMPLEMENTING USB COMMUNICATION DEVICE CLASS (CDC) ON SiM3U1XX MCUs__ -- provides an implementation example on porting LUFA USB CDC on SiM3U1xx MCUs.\r\n* __AN0822 SIMPLICITY STUDIO USERâ€™S GUIDE__ -- provides a description of the Simplicity Studio IDE features and environment.\r\n* __AN0065 EFM32 as USB Device__ -- provides a description of the EFM32 USB Device stack.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 3. USB CDC Class\r\nThe USB communications device class (CDC) is a composite USB device class, and the class may include more than one interface. The CDC is used primarily for modems, but also for ISDN, fax machines, and telephony applications for performing regular voice calls.\r\nThe Abstract Control Model subclass of CDC and bridges the gap between legacy modem devices and USB devices, enabling the use of application programs designed for older modems.\r\n\r\n### 3.1. Class Requests\r\nThe class requests and class notifications supported are listed in Table 1.\r\n\r\n__Table 1.

USB CDC Communication FLow__\r\n\r\n## 4. LUFA USB Stack  \r\nThe USB CDC firmware example is based on the `LUFA` open-source project. `LUFA` is an open-source complete USB stack released under the permissive MIT License. It includes support for many USB classes, both for USB Hosts and USB Devices. For USB Devices, the `LUFA` stack includes support for Audio Class, CDC Class, HID Class, Mass Storage Class, MIDI Class, and RNDIS Class.\r\nMore information about the `LUFA` project can be found on the official website: http://www.fourwalledcubicle.com/LUFA.php\r\n\r\n* The USB CDC project contains a prebuilt LUFA USB stack documentation which locate at .\\LUFA\\Documentation\\html. Double click on the index.html, the documentations shows in your default browser.\r\n\r\n![LUFA documentation][LUFA_DOC]\r\n\r\n__Figure 3. USB LUFA Libary Documentation__\r\n\r\n* This implementation support two boards of EFM32GG, STK3700 and DK3750. Default setting is DK3750, To change board selection, just modify macro definition in .\\LUFA\\Common\\BoardTypes.h. \r\n\r\n``` c\r\n#if !defined(__DOXYGEN__)\r\n    #define BOARD_                 BOARD_DK3750\r\n    #if !defined(BOARD)\r\n        #define BOARD              BOARD_DK3750\r\n    #endif\r\n#endif\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor STK3700 board, there is no UART socket on board. UART signals are connected to EXP Header. \r\n\r\n![USART on EXP][USART_ON_EXP]\r\n\r\n__Figure 4. USART signals on STK3700 Expansion Header__\r\n\r\n## 5. USB CDC Driver\r\nThe CDC class is implemented in all releases of Windows, and the operatingsystem needs an INF file for the CDC driver. This INF file contains the Vendor ID and Product ID. If the VID/PID of the USB devices matches the INF file, Windows will load the driver described in the file. The __VirtualSerial.inf__ file can be found in the __.\\Demos\\Device\\LowLevel\\EFM32Demos\\VCP__ directory. \r\n\r\n### Installing the Driver\r\nTo install the driver on Windows 7:\r\n\r\n1. Build the project and download firmware to the EFM32GG DK3750 board.\r\n2. Connect the USB cable between the Device MCU plugin board USB connector  and the PC.\r\n3. Open Device Manager. The device will appear under __Other devices__ as the __EFM32GG CDC Device__.\r\n![Device Manager][Device_Manager]\r\n4. Right-click on the __EFM32GG CDC Device__ and select __Update Driver Software__.\r\n![Device Manager Update][Device_Manager_Update]\r\n5. Select __Browse my computer for driver software__.\r\n![Updata Driver Software][Updata_Driver_Software]\r\n6. Select __Browse my computer for driver software__.\r\n![Browse Driver Software][Browse_Driver_Software]\r\n7. Windows will display a warning. Select __Install this driversoftware anyway__.\r\n![Windows Sercurity][Windows_Sercurity]\r\n8. When the driver finishes installing,Windows will report the installation results.\r\n9. Open Device Manager and observethe device. It will now appear under __Ports (COM & LPT)__ with an assigned COM port number.\r\n![Device Manager Done][Device_Manager_Done]\r\n\r\n\r\n## CONTACT INFORMATION\r\n\r\n__Silicon Laboratories Inc.__ \r\n400 West Cesar Chavez\r\nAustin, TX 78701\r\nTel: 1+(512) 416-8500\r\nFax: 1+(512) 416-9669\r\nToll Free: 1+(877) 444-3032\r\nPlease visit the Silicon Labs Technical Support web page:\r\nhttps://www.silabs.com/support/pages/contacttechnicalsupport.aspx\r\nand register to submit a technical support request.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[USB_CDC_Intro]:file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/usb_cdc_intro.png \"USB CDC Virtual COM POrt system\"\r\n[CDC_USB_LOG]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/CDC_com_flow.png \"CDC USB log\"\r\n[LUFA_DOC]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/lufa-documentation.png \"LUFA USB documentation\"\r\n[USART_ON_EXP]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/usart_signals_on_EXP_header.png \"USART signals on STK3700 Expansion Header\"\r\n[Device_Manager]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/device_manager.png\r\n[Device_Manager_Update]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/device_manager_update.png\r\n[Updata_Driver_Software]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/update_driver_software.png\r\n[Browse_Driver_Software]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/browse_driver_software.png\r\n[Windows_Sercurity]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/windows_security.png\r\n[Device_Manager_Done]: file:///C:/Users/mading/Dropbox/work/Bitbucket/lufa/Demos/Device/LowLevel/EFM32Demos/images/device_manager_done.png\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
